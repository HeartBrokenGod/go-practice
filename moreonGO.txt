1. new() function
Memory returned by new() is zeroed.
new() only returns pointers to initialized memory.
new() works for all the data types (except channel, map), and dynamically allocates space for a variable of that type and initialized it to zero value of that type and return a pointer to it.

2. make() func
make() only makes slices, maps, and channels. make returns value of type T(data type) not *T
